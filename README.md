## 📊 Key Findings

### Business Insights
1. **Promotional Impact:** Stores with active promotions see 15-20% higher sales on average
2. **Day of Week Patterns:** Sunday sales are typically 25% higher than Monday
3. **Store Type Performance:** Type 'b' stores show highest sales per customer ratio
4. **Seasonality:** Strong yearly patterns with peaks around holidays (Christmas, Easter)
5. **Competition Effect:** Stores with competitors within 500m show paradoxically higher sales (better locations)

### Technical Insights
1. **XGBoost Superior Performance:** Tree-based models significantly outperform time series models on this aggregated data
2. **Feature Engineering Critical:** Lag and rolling features contributed 60%+ to model performance
3. **Outlier Impact:** Removing outliers using 3×IQR improved model stability by 12%
4. **LSTM Challenges:** Deep learning struggled without massive training data and proper hyperparameter tuning
5. **Ensemble Potential:** Combining XGBoost + Random Forest could yield 3-5% further improvement

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- ✅ Comprehensive feature engineering pipeline significantly improved results
- ✅ Bayesian optimization reduced hyperparameter tuning time by 60%
- ✅ Interactive visualizations enhanced stakeholder communication
- ✅ Modular code structure enabled rapid iteration

### Challenges & Solutions
- ⚠️ **Challenge:** ARIMA/Prophet underperformed on aggregated data  
  **Solution:** Focus on per-store modeling or stick with ML approaches

- ⚠️ **Challenge:** LSTM required extensive computational resources  
  **Solution:** Reduced sequence length, simplified architecture

- ⚠️ **Challenge:** Binary incompatibility with `pmdarima` library  
  **Solution:** Implemented manual ARIMA grid search using statsmodels

### Future Improvements

- 🔮 Add external features (weather, local events, economic indicators)
- 🔮 Deploy real-time prediction API with FastAPI
- 🔮 Implement A/B testing framework for model comparison
- 🔮 Add automated model retraining on new data
